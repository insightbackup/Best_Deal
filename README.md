## PROBLEM STATEMENT
This project shows historical Airbnb price over the time, allowing travelers plan their trip wisely based on their budget, available time and selected city to visit.
For example you might not care much between visiting London or Paris or also between January or February, and having historical knowledge about average prices in cities and months can help you with your decision making process a lot.
